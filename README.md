# Eden Essame Wakeboarding website

## Code Institute - First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development.

This website was developed to showcase my ability to design and create a static website, using HTML and CSS.

It is a website about a fictional wakeboard park in the town in which I live in. Users of the website will be able to find all the information they need to know about the wakeboard park, services offered, prices, location and contact information. The site is targeted towards towards any potential customers who may be interested in wakeboarding.

## Features

### Navigation

-The navigation bar is at the top of the page and fixed, so always visible and accessable wherever the user is on the page.
-The navigation bar shows the business name in the top left corner.
-The other navigation links are to the right: Home, About Us, Prices and contact. They become a drop down menu on smaller screens where they would take up too much screen space.
-The navigation bar tells the user the name of the business and website and the differnt sections of information are easy to find
