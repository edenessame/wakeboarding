# Eden Essame Wakeboarding website

## Code Institute - First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development.

This website was developed to showcase my ability to design and create a static website.

It is a website about a fictional wakeboard park in the town that I live in.

## Table of Contents

## UX
The website targets customers to the wakeboard park.

## User Stories
As the sole developer of this website, my goal is to inform potential customers about the wakeboard park.
I identified the following points that a user may need.

-As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website quickly and easily.
-As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate the website, using a mouse, a keyboard or a touch screen.
-As a user, I want to know information about the wakeboard park.
-As a user, I want to know the prices charged.
-As a user, I want to get in touch with the business to ask questions.
-As a user, I want to know the opening times.
-As a user, I want to know the location.
-As a user, I want to be able to visit their social media pages.

### Strategy
The goal is to make an easy to use website, with all of the needed information.

### Scope
For the users (customers) I wanted to give a good overview of all the information I thought they might need.

### Structure
The website has a single, scrolling page design, with a fixed navigation menu at the top, from which the user can navigate easily to the different sections from anywhere on the page.
