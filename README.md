# Eden Essame Wakeboarding website

## Code Institute - First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development.

This website was developed to showcase my ability to design and create a static website, using HTML and CSS.

It is a website about a fictional wakeboard park in the town in which I live in. Users of the website will be able to find all the information they need to know about the wakeboard park, services offered, prices, location and contact information. The site is targeted towards towards any potential customers who may be interested in wakeboarding.
